<h2 id="WHAT" >1)WHAT IS AFFILIATE MARKETING?</h2>

 <p>
 &nbsp<b>Affiliate marketing</b> is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another person’s or company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another. 
 <br>
 <br>
 &nbsp<b> Affiliate marketing</b> is a great way to drive sales and generate significant online revenue. Extremely beneficial to both brands and affiliate marketers, the new push toward less traditional marketing tactics has certainly paid off. 
<br>
<br>
In fact, affiliate marketing spend in the United States increased from $5.4 billion in 2017 to $8.2 billion in 2022 — which means there’s plenty of room for those looking to get a piece of the pie.
<br>
This step-by-step beginner’s guide will walk you through how to launch your affiliating marketing business and what benefits you can expect.

 <h2 id="HOW">2)HOW DOES AFFILIATE MARKETING WORK? </h2>
  <p>

Because <b>affiliate marketing</b> works by spreading the responsibilities of product marketing and creation across parties, it leverages the abilities of a variety of individuals for a more effective marketing strategy while providing contributors with a share of the profit. To make this work, three different parties must be involved:
</br>
<br>
<i>Seller and product creators.
</br>
<br>
The affiliate or advertiser.
</br>
<br>
The consumer.</i>
</br>
<br>
Let’s delve into the complex relationship these three parties share to ensure affiliate marketing is a success:

<h2 id="TYPES">3) Types of Affiliate Marketing

 </h2>
 <p>It’s often unclear whether an <b>affiliate marketer </b>has actually used the product they’re promoting or if they’re simply in it for the money — sometimes it may not matter to the customer one way or the other. 
</br>
<br>
But other times, such as with diet services or skincare products, the customer may not trust an affiliate unless they know that he/she has tested and approved the product themselves.
</br>
<br>
In 2009, renowned affiliate marketer Pat Flynn categorized<b> affiliate marketing</b> into three types — unattached, related and involved — to help differentiate between affiliate marketers who are closely tied to a product versus those who are not. 

Here we’ll break down each category to help you decide which route to take
<h3><i>Unattached. </i></h3>

In the unattached business model, the affiliate marketer has no connection to the product or service they are promoting. They have no expertise or authority in the niche of the product, nor can they make claims about its use.
<br>
<br>
Typically, an unattached affiliate will run <mark>PPC (pay-per-click) </mark>marketing campaigns, using an affiliate link in hopes that shoppers will click it and make a purchase on their own.
<br>
<br>
While unattached <b>affiliate marketing </b>may be attractive due to its lack of commitment, it’s generally for those who simply want to generate an income without investing in the product or customer relationship.

<h3><i>Related.</i></h3>

A happy medium between unattached and involved, related <b>affiliate marketing</b> is for those who don’t necessarily use the product or service, but who are somehow related to the niche audience. These affiliates often have some sort of influence in the niche and an established following, and can therefore offer some authority.
<br>
<br>
For example, perhaps you’re promoting a clothing brand you’ve never used before, but you have an audience through a fashion blog or YouTube channel. In this case, you would be considered a related affiliate marketer.
<br>
<br>
The advantage of this type of <b>affiliate marketing</b> is that the affiliate has the expertise to generate traffic, however they may risk recommending a bad product or service if they’ve never actually used it before, potentially costing them the trust of their audience.
<br>
<br>
<h3><i>Involved.</i></h3>

As the name suggests, involved <b>affiliate marketing </b>describes those who are closely tied to the product or service they’re promoting. The affiliate has tried the product themselves, trusts that it will provide a good experience and has the authority to make claims about its use.
<br>
<br>
Rather than relying on pays per click, involved affiliate marketers use their personal experiences with the product in their marketing efforts, and customers can trust them as reliable sources of information. 
<br>
<br>
Of course, this type of <b>affiliate marketing </b>requires more legwork and time to build credibility, but it will likely result in greater payoffs down the road.

<br>
<h2 id="HOW DO">4) How Do Affiliate Marketers Get Paid?</h2>
<p>A quick and inexpensive method of making money without the hassle of actually selling a product,<b>affiliate marketing </b>has an undeniable draw for those looking to increase their income online. But how does an affiliate get paid after linking the seller to the consumer?
<br>
<br>
The answer can get complicated.
<br>
<br>
The consumer doesn’t always need to buy the product for the affiliate to get a kickback. Depending on the program, the affiliate’s contribution to the seller’s sales will be measured differently.
<br>
<br>
The affiliate may get paid in various ways:
<br>
<br>
<i>
  Pay per sale.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pay per lead.
  <br>
  <br>
  Pay per click.
